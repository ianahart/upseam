# Upseam

## How It Works

A website where people can post pictures and descriptions of specialized clothing they want made for them, and seamsters can submit bids to make the clothing for them, including their profiles, ratings, and prices.
Users can either be Users(request clothing to be made) or Seamsters (will bid on the clothing).
Users can connect with Seamsters and chat about making the clothing.

## Tools Used

- Chakra UI
- TypeScript + React
